# Airline-Palindrome-Simulator
Simulates airline account registration and flight booking and implements palindrome function checking

Palindrome: 

The term palindrome is define as a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of
characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as MADAM or KAYAK.
The term “palindrome” has Greek roots from the words palin (“again”) and dromos
(“way, direction”) by way of the English writer Ben Jonson. Some palindromes seem
to be philosophical. Others tell a story. In any case, they are unique and often times
creatively thoughtful compositions of literature used for constrained writing.

Program Objectives:

Create a JAVA program that implements data structures Stack and Arraylist to simulate airline account creation. 
The simulated airline account creation will initially ask the user to enter a name, birthdate, password and pin. The stores user input will track a user's login to mimic the user toaccess their ticket information( i.e, manually assigning them flights (trip info) withorigin airport, departure time, destination airport, return time, ticket price, or allowing the user to select from a stored listing of available flights).
